# Home Assistant Config
Homeassistant is an open source platform that puts local control of device, integrating smart devices and link to HomeKit by Apple. I am currently doing a project that making my home become smarter. Config files are stored here for backups and version control. Used Raspberry Pi 4 as a server to run it.
